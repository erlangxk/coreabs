Perfect—let’s keep **Day A** as your go-to home-friendly baseline, and I’ll give you **two fresh versions of Day B**:

### **Day B – Home Version (No Equipment, Core Focus + Rotation)**
**All bodyweight. Just need a mat or soft surface.**

1. **Side Plank with Reach-Through** – 3 x 10 reps each side  
   *Engages obliques and improves rotational control.*  
2. **V-Ups or Tuck Crunches** – 3 x 15  
   *Targets upper and lower abs.*  
3. **Lying Windshield Wipers** – 3 x 10–12 per side  
   *Great for obliques and core control.*  
4. **Plank Shoulder Taps** – 3 x 20 (10 each side)  
   *Anti-rotation and core stability.*  
5. **Reverse Crunches** – 3 x 15  
   *Focuses on lower abs.*

**Optional Finisher:** 30 seconds of **mountain climbers** x 3 rounds (for a cardio core burn)

   *Anti-rotation training with resistance.*
